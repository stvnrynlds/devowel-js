# devowel-js
Nab vowels.

# Steven what did you make
Devoweler takes a string of text, wraps each word with `span.word`, each letter with `span.char`, and each vowel with `span.char.vwl`. Pair that with some shmancy CSS animations and you can do some neat-o stuff.

# Steven why did you make this
Hahaha
